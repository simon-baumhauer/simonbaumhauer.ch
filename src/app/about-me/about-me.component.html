            <h4>Where I come from </h4>
            <p>As a Healthcare professional and nurse, I deeply connected with the human element in hospital settings and elderly homes to learn how important good caring, listening, and communication skills are to alleviate the most pressing needs of patients and their relatives. At the same time, I realized how essential it is to create a lean digital environment to work with.
